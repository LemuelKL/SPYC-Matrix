in our lives. 


When you pay attention to tiny decent events, your mood can be altered,

humour of the day (Since they often misspell customers‘ names). It is

the small details happening in your everyday life that you often take them 
for granted. Besides, misfortunes in life are inevitable, yet a positive 
mindset can be developed to help you looking at the unpleasant affairs on

hour earlier than my usual schedule from time to time. Once I finish my 
work of the day, I would try my best to fit into the ideal bedtime 
schedule. If I succeed, I will feel so refreshed and satisfied the next 
morning. Notably for school days, I’ll feel energetic and have extra 
motivation to study. In addition, another minor yet essential procedure 
is to have breakfast. It isn’t necessary to be a substantial one, having 
a small bun or a few spoons of congee is adequate to become a mental 
support. It makes me feel I can acquire knowledge more effectively in 
lessons. These little tips mentioned above were just procedures that are

ten minutes before bed to recall every small moments happened or actions

app to records details of the day if you found write on conventional 
diaries time-consuming.  You will gradually realise there are many minute 
events in life that seem to be negligible, but in fact, they matter and 
mean a whole lot more than you thought. It will be gratifying to read all 
the small issues accumulated.

they aren’t. You should bare this in mind: Tiny events can still bring you 
paramount of contentment. If you often find yourself in dismay,  this is 
might as well a good method to let out of frustration.
